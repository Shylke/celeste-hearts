# celeste-hearts
Main repo for the heart emotes inspired by the famous game.
If you're coming from Mastodon/Fediverse you're probably looking for the packs which can be located in the Fediverse Packs folder. If you're coming here from another place... well hello there, I guess.

# Template - Make Your Own Hearts
You will need:
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or any other program capable of opening and modifying `.aseprite` files.
- An eyedropper tool. This can be the one included in Aseprite (or any other art program of your choice), or a separate on-screen color picker. (see below)
  - For Windows: [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/);
  - For Linux (Universal): [Color Picker](https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/nl.hjdskes.gcolor3) app from FlatHub;
    - For GNOME: [Color Picker Extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3396/color-picker/)
    - For KDE: should already be included in the base DE, open the widget menu, search for "color picker" and add it to your screen;
    - For Cinnamon: open the applet menu, search for "color picker", download the applet and add it to your panel.

It is highly recommended to use the `Template (14 frames).aseprite` file located in the Templates folder for simple flags with horizontal lines. For flags with vertical, diagonal lines, or otherwise more complex designs, it is advised to use `Template (28 frames).aseprite`.

Colors should be sourced from the original flag with a few exceptions:
- Do **not** use pure black (#000000) as it'll blend with the heart's frame, instead use an off black (#0F0F0F);
- Do **not** use pure white (#FFFFFF) as it'll blend with the shine effects, instead use a very light grey (#EAEAEA);
- You may slightly tweak the colors if the contrast is too low when applying them to the heart.
